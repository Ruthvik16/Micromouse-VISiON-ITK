# Micromouse-VISiON-ITK

Current Progress -

(1) To detect a turn we used 5 ultrasonic sensors (left, right, front, right diagonal and left diagonal)

(2) For turning we used PID using feedback from two motor encoders (for positiion) and an accelerometer (MPU6050) (for heading angle) 

(3) We used servo motors to control the steering angle 


Current Doubts -

(1) Can we use LiDAR instead of sensors as they will detect the turn better and its use can replace encoders ?

(2) PID tuning ?
